          ABOUT INSTITUTE:<br><br><br>


The Council of Education was established under the auspicious leadership of Late Dr.<br>
Ratnappa Kumbhar. We take pride in being guided by late Dr. Ratnappa Kumbhar,<br>
who was a reputed Freedom Fighter social reformer, notable senior political leader,<br>
and educationist and honored as “Sahakar Maharshee”.<br>
He was awarded by Doctorate by Poona University and Padmashree by Government of India.<br>
At present, the Council of Education runs the following colleges<br><br><br>
          
1-Shahaji Law College (Estd.1933)<br>
2-D.R.K. College of Commerce (Estd.1957)<br>
3-Night College of Arts and Commerce (Estd.1971)<br>
          
In the western region of Maharashtra,
the council of Education played a pioneering role in imparting education in Law,<br>
Commerce and Management to tap the talent from this area. D.R.K. College was established in 1957<br>
when there was no commerce college from Pune to Belgaum. M.B.A. Courses started in 1971<br>
because there was no management education available in this area.<br><br><br>
          
D.R.K. College of Commerce is in the heart of city and equipped<br>
with excellent infrastructure and facilities. It is one of the reputed single faculty<br>
Commerce College in this region.<br><br><br><br>
          
The college started enrolling 135 students in an old building known as "Paha building".<br>
At present H.S.C (General and M.C.V.C), B. Com., M. Com., BBA and MBA,Bca<br>
classes run in this college.<br>
BBA started in the year 2006 as it was need of society.<br>
A strength of more than 5230 students today happens to be the pride of the institute.<br>
Day by day the strength of girl students has increased from 4 to 2700 during last five decades.<br>
Approximately 60 percent of the strength comprises of girls in this college.<br><br><br>
          
During the 1970's there was crucial need for professionally educated personnel<br>
from the developing industrial sector. Such facilities were not available in this region.<br>
To cater to the needs of the society,<br>
the Council of Education started the post graduate course of Management (M.B.A.)<br>
in 1971 without monetary consideration.<br><br><br>
          
In addition to this the college has been recognized for their valuable contribution<br>
to conduct classes of C.A., C.S., C.M.A. from 2003.<br>
<br><br><br>
The college is an approved center for National level Professional examination<br>
like C.A., C.M.A and ICFAL.<br><br>
          
The College has provided a favorable environment for candidate coming from<br>
Kolhapur and as well as the neighboring districts like<br>
Sangali, Satara, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Solapur.<br><br><br><br>
          
After a difficult path and strong efforts to sustain<br>
the college celebrated the Silver Jubilee in 1985.<br>
There was a 3-day celebration organized by the institution which comprised of<br>
multiple colorful & attractive programs This program was graced by<br>
our loving Vice President of India Honorable late Shri Venkatraman.<br>
On this auspicious day the institute was named as Deshbhakt Ratnappa Kumbhar college of Commerce.<br>
On the same day the computer department was inaugurated in the presence of Honorable Ex.<br>
Vice President of India Late Shri B. D. Jatti.<br>
The alumni association had organized a program to celebrate the<br>
Silver Jubilee marking the completion of 25 successful years.<br>
During the due course we propose to celebrate the Golden Jubilee and mark the historic<br>
completion of successful years of glory. The institute has been a remarkable asset and its<br>
contribution is noteworthy towards the development of society.<br><br><br>
